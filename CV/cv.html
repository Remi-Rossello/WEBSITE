        <p>
          7 weeks among the planetologists of the "Cosmochemistry and Planetology" division of the CRPG, 
          a well-known French geology institute and part of the National Scientific Research Center (CNRS). <br/><br/> 
          I had the chance to become co-author of a scientific paper by planetary scientist Jessica Flahaut, 
          presented at the European Lunar Symposium 2025 in Münster, Germany, as well as Nicolas Theret, 
          a French Space Agency (CNES) engineer. <br/><br/>
          <em> Objectives: </em> <br/><br/>
          1. In preparation for a confidential future lunar mission, 
          create an IDL program to simulate the spectral vision of CNES instruments and automate mineral identification. <br/>
          2. Learn about lunar geology and measure the spectral characteristics of rock samples including from the Moon, Mars, and Vesta. <br/><br/>
          I had a good time with my tutor Jessica Flahaut and colleagues Mélissa Martinot, Blandine Godet, and Clarisse Peignaux.

          • Materials selection for our Demo-1 lunar mission initially planned for 2027.
          Evaluation of thermal expansion, ductile/brittle behavior, chemical and
          radiation resistance of alloys and polymers. <br/><br/>
          
          • Experimental work on a low-pressure TRL3 microwave system to extract and
          condense volatile substances from lunar regolith simulants LHS-1 and LSP. The
          goal is to produce clean water and rocket fuel on the Moon from regolith. <br/><br/>
          
          • Assistance in the design and selection of commercial parts for TRL4
          subsystems: hopper, microwave cavity, condenser, and heat recovery unit. <br/><br/>
          
          • Experiments, analysis, and documentation on microwave recycling of orbital
          station organic waste into biochar for soil fertilization and other applications.
          Initiative to quickly create an image analysis program to automatically map
          sample characteristics. <br/><br/>
          
          This contract for a 6-month internship only lasted 3 months due to unexpected
          financial problems at OffWorld EU.
