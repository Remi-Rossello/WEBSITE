        <p>
          7 weeks among the planetologists of the "Cosmochemistry and Planetology" division of the CRPG, 
          a well-known French geology institute and part of the National Scientific Research Center (CNRS). <br/><br/> 
          I had the chance to become co-author of a scientific paper by planetary scientist Jessica Flahaut, 
          presented at the European Lunar Symposium 2025 in Münster, Germany, as well as Nicolas Theret, 
          a French Space Agency (CNES) engineer. <br/><br/>
          <em> Objectives: </em> <br/><br/>
          1. In preparation for a confidential future lunar mission, 
          create an IDL program to simulate the spectral vision of CNES instruments and automate mineral identification. <br/>
          2. Learn about lunar geology and measure the spectral characteristics of rock samples including from the Moon, Mars, and Vesta. <br/><br/>
          I had a good time with my tutor Jessica Flahaut and colleagues Mélissa Martinot, Blandine Godet, and Clarisse Peignaux.
